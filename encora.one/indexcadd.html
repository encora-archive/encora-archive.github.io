<p><b><i>Here's a quick roundup of stories you might have missed recently.</i></b></p>

<p><b>No Plan Set for <i>Mindhunter</i> Season Three</b><br>
Looks like Two-time Tony nominee <a href="https://www.broadway.com/buzz/stars/jonathan-groff/profile/">Jonathan Groff</a> is hanging up his badge. The Broadway star headlined the first two seasons of <i>Mindhunter </i>as special agent Holden Ford. The psychological thriller series, based on John Douglas and Mark Olshaker's 1996 nonfiction book <i>Mind Hunter: Inside the FBI's Elite Serial Crime Unit</i>, is indefinitely on pause. "When I got done [with season two], I was pretty exhausted, and I said, ‘I don’t know if I have it in me right now to break season three," executive producer and director David Fincher said in a recent <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2020/10/mindhunter-season-three-not-happening.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview</a>. Netflix has not confirmed the show is done forever, however. “Maybe in five years,” a spokeperson cracked. You never know.</p>

<p><b>Edith O'Hara Dies at 103</b><br>
Edith O'Hara has died at the age of 103, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/24/theater/edith-ohara-dead.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><i>The New York Times</i></a>. Born on February 15, 1917 in Idaho, O'Hara arrived in New York City later in her life, taking with her a show called <i>Touch</i>, which she had developed in Warren, Pennsylvania at a small theater company she founded. An off-off-Broadway stalwart, she founded the 13th Street …</p>

<p>Living near the theater district during <a href="https://www.broadway.com/buzz/198775/broadway-shuts-down-performances-canceled-through-april-12-due-to-covid-19-pandemic/">the Broadway shutdown</a>, photographer and performer Matthew Stocke has been haunted walking past the empty palaces sitting in repose, waiting for the lights and stars to return. In this new Broadway.com photo feature, he reunites members of the theater community with their Broadway home #<i>AwayFromHome.</i></p>


<p><strong>CAESAR SAMAYOA<br>
<em>COME FROM AWAY</em></strong></p>

<p>On March 12, <a href="https://www.broadway.com/buzz/stars/caesar-samayoa/profile/">Caesar Samayoa</a> and the <a href="https://www.broadway.com/shows/come-away/"><i>Come From Away</i></a> comapny had intended to celebrate the show's three-year Broadway anniversary. Instead, Samayoa received a text message on his way to physical therapy saying the show was <a href="https://www.broadway.com/buzz/199967/broadway-shows-to-remain-shut-down-through-may-30-2021/">shutting down</a> due to the coronavirus crisis. Having been involved with <i>Come From Away</i> since its development, Samayoa—like his fellow longtime cast members and super fans who have seen the show again and again—finds the hit musical to be a spiritual salve. Here, the performer examines how the musical about a small town welcoming stranded travelers in the aftermath of 9/11 relates to the present.</p>

<p>Stephen Whitson and Nair are at the helm of the new musical, which features a book co-written by Arpita Mukherjee and the film's screenwriter Sabrina Dhawan, with music by Vishal Bhardwaj and lyrics by Masi Asare and two-time Tony nominee Susan Birkenhead.</p>

<p>"We are going to open next year, November 2021," Nair said to <i>Variety</i>. "First in India, and then in Singapore, and Dubai, perhaps, and then bring it to London and the United States." The musical made its world premiere at Berkeley Repertory Theatre in 2017 and was <a href="https://www.broadway.com/buzz/188684/berkeley-reps-monsoon-wedding-musical-is-broadway-bound/">previously rumored</a> for Broadway.</p>

<p>Ming Cho Lee, who designed numerous Broadway sets, took home a special Tony Award for Lifetime Achievement in 2013 and instructed many aspiring designers, has died at the age of 90.

<p>Born on October 3, 1930 in Shanghai, the designer moved to the United States in 1949. He went on to make his Broadway debut in 1956 as the technical assistant on <em>Happy Hunting</em>. He garnered his first Tony nomination in 1970 for <i>Billy</i>. His credits spanned Shakespeare revivals, <i>for colored girls who have considered suicide / when the rainbow is enuf</i>, <i>The Glass Menagerie</i> and more. Lee's design for <i>K2</i>, a play about two mountain climbers who find themselves trapped on a ledge of the second-highest mountain in the world, won a Tony Award in 1983.</p>

<p>His off-Broadway design credits were also expansive: he notably created the set for <i>Hair</i> at the Public Theater in 1967. Lee designed nationally and internationally for over 50 years for opera, dance, Broadway and regional theater. During his illustrious career, he received …</p>
